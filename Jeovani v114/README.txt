Copy the "User" Folder and place it in your SPT-AKI directory. "Jeovani" should appear in your mod folder and in the game.

-Overview-

​Captain Jacob "Jeovani" Carter is one of the last remaining US Assets in the region. Setting up shop as an armorer on the city limits, he helps outfit abandoned USEC forces...for a price. With his pipeline of American surplus rifles and ammunition, Jeovani will give you the tools you need to survive, but the tasks he may ask you to perform in exchange may be a bit more than you have bargained for. Are you willing to be used if it means you can get a leg up on your enemies? What cost is too high for a decent gun and some nice ammo?

​Welcome to my first SPT mod! The purpose of this trader is to provide both high quality NATO ammunition to players who are tired of keeping their best weapons sidelined for raid-exclusive ammo, as well as develop a new and unique questline for players to enjoy as they make their way through the city ruins. My end goal with this trader, and the trader that follows him, is to pit your PMC against the world of Tarkov, and give them an avenue to return home by helping the CIA accomplish it's mission in the city.
​
​There is a planned Russian Trader, which will pit BEAR PMCs against USEC. Until then, Jeovani is available to both factions.
